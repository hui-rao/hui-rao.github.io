Hui (Amy) Rao is a PhD student at the School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne. She obtained her master’s degree from the UQ Business School, The University of Queensland. Her research interests include human–AI interactions, misinformation mitigation on social media, and social media user behaviour. She employs natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and econometric techniques in her research to analyse structured, unstructured, and complex data. Her current work emphasizes theory-driven feature engineering in machine learning and the role of empathetic AI in human behaviour. She is also interested in data-driven, computationally intensive theory development and related computational approaches. Her papers appear in conference proceedings such as the Pacific-Asia Conference on Information Systems and Australian Conference on Information Systems.

Research Experiences
======
**Fake News Detection through Theory Based Feature Selection**

- **Activities:**  Explored advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enhance fake news detection using tweet semantic information, developed innovative methods to analyse and interpret semantic cues in tweets, and conducted evaluations to assess the effectiveness of methods in improving the accuracy. Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) of persuasion based feature development for the detection of fake news. 

- **Outcomes:** Completion of Master’s thesis (20,000 words), ***published in the Pacific-Asia Conference on Information Systems (PACIS 2025) and the International Conference on Information Systems TREO (ICIS 2024 TREO). Preparing for a submission at the Journal of Strategic Information Systems (JSIS) by 2026.*** Presented at PACIS 2025, ICIS 2024 and the UQ BIS End of Year Conference on 19 November 2024.
