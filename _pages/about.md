Hui (Amy) Rao is a PhD student at the School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne. She obtained her master’s degree from the UQ Business School, The University of Queensland. Her research interests include human–AI interactions, misinformation mitigation on social media, and social media user behaviour. She employs natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and econometric techniques in her research to analyse structured, unstructured, and complex data. Her current work emphasizes theory-driven feature engineering in machine learning and the role of empathetic AI in human behaviour. She is also interested in data-driven, computationally intensive theory development and related computational approaches. Her papers appear in conference proceedings such as the Pacific-Asia Conference on Information Systems and Australian Conference on Information Systems.

Research Experiences
======


**Exploring the “Dark Patterns” of LLM-based AI Companions and User Perceived Intimacy**

- **Activities:**  As a PhD research stream, developing a four-study program to investigate how “dark patterns” may emerge in LLM-based AI companions and how they shape user outcomes, with a particular focus on user perceived intimacy. Study 1 conducts a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AI companion research and produce a conceptual paper. Subsequent studies employ experimental methods alongside qualitative and computational approaches to uncover dark-pattern mechanisms in AI companions. 

- **Outcomes:** Preparing for PhD thesis. ***Drafted a conceptual paper and preparing submission to a top-tier IS journal by 2026.*** Developing research design and instruments for upcoming empirical studies.

**Theory-Driven Feature Engineering Process in Machine Learning (ML)**

- **Activities:**  Developed a theory-driven feature engineering process framework that systematically integrates data transformation, feature extraction, and feature selection for machine learning approaches, covering both traditional ML models and deep learning workflows. The work focuses on how theoretical lenses can guide feature engineering, so that feature engineering is not only predictive but also explanatory—supporting subsequent research that builds data-driven theoretical models grounded in well-defined constructs and mechanisms. 

- **Outcomes:** ***Submitted a full paper to the European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS 2026). Preparing a submission to a top-tier IS journal.***

**Fake News Detection through Theory Based Feature Selection**

- **Activities:**  Explored advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enhance fake news detection using tweet semantic information, developed innovative methods to analyse and interpret semantic cues in tweets, and conducted evaluations to assess the effectiveness of methods in improving the accuracy. Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) of persuasion based feature development for the detection of fake news. 

- **Outcomes:** Completion of Master’s thesis (20,000 words), ***published in the Pacific-Asia Conference on Information Systems (PACIS 2025) and the International Conference on Information Systems TREO (ICIS 2024 TREO). Preparing for a submission at the Journal of Strategic Information Systems (JSIS) by 2026.*** Presented at PACIS 2025, ICIS 2024 and the UQ BIS End of Year Conference on 19 November 2024.

**Exploring the Impact of Online Reviews on Book Sales Using NLP Techniques**

- **Activities:** Dedicated to studying text mining and machine learning techniques, focusing on aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) and emotion analysis. Conducted research on text mining and topic modelling to extract insights from online reviews and identify key features.

- **Outcomes:** Accepted by ANZAM-OSCSM Symposium, and ***future research is being prepared for submission to the Journal of Computers in Human Behavior by 2026.***
